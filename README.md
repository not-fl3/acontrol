# acontrol

acontrol is small time-tracking web site written in Haskell using Spock, Heist and MongoDB.

The goal of acontrol is to provide a self-controlling utility, with only one simple feature - control, how much time you really spent on assigned task. 

Project is at very early stage of development, but may be useful anyway :)
